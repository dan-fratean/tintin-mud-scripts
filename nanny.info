voidchant:
Your journey into the void has barely begun.
Your mastery of the inner mysteries is weak at best.
You need to practice many, many more rituals.
Your chant surpasses that of the novices.
Your void chant is somewhat accomplished.
Performing the chant feels comforting to you.
During the chant, you tend to forget your physical self.
Your ability to draw upon the minds of the dead is impressive.
The dead voices speak to you of long forgotten secrets.
Your mind is warmed by the chill of the void.
You feel more at ease whispering with the dead than the living.
The void chant comes naturally to you.
Your void chant carries the voice of the void.			- Whisperer in the Void
Your chant is the sound of dry leaves whispering in nothingness.
You have attained great mastery in performing the void chant.
Your link to the void is unparalleled.
One foot has crossed the threshold. The void is near.
The void is your home. The void fills you. You are one.
