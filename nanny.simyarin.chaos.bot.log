The plains are dry from lack of rain, and the hot summer air hangs heavy around
you. The grass is yellowing, and there is no shade when the sun is up. To the
distant north you see the mighty Dragonspine mountains, and long for their cool
heights. 
It is noon; the sun hangs high in the sky.
An old ruined castle lies just to the northwest.
  There are five obvious exits: east, west, north, south and northwest.
